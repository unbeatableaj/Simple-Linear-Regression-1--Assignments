# Introduction 

Simple Linear Regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and a single independent variable. In this project, we will be performing Simple Linear Regression on the Salary_Data.csv dataset to analyze the relationship between an employee's years of experience and their salary.

# Data Description

The Salary_Data.csv dataset contains two columns - "YearsExperience" and "Salary". "YearsExperience" represents the number of years of experience of an employee, and "Salary" represents the corresponding salary of that employee.

# Methodology

We will be using Simple Linear Regression to model the relationship between "YearsExperience" and "Salary". Simple Linear Regression assumes that there is a linear relationship between the dependent variable and independent variable. We will first visualize the relationship between the two variables using a scatter plot. Then we will fit a linear regression model and check its accuracy using the R-squared value. Finally, we will use the model to make predictions on new data.

# Results

Our analysis showed a positive linear relationship between an employee's years of experience and their salary. The scatter plot showed a clear trend, with the salary increasing as the years of experience increased.

The linear regression model had an R-squared value of 0.9569, indicating a strong correlation between the two variables. This means that 95.70% of the variation in salary can be explained by the variation in years of experience.

Using the linear regression model, we can make predictions on the salary of an employee given their years of experience.

# Conclusion

Simple Linear Regression is a powerful tool for modeling the relationship between two variables. In this project, we used Simple Linear Regression to model the relationship between an employee's years of experience and their salary. Our analysis showed a strong positive linear relationship between the two variables, with the salary increasing as the years of experience increased.

This model can be used to make predictions on the salary of new employees given their years of experience. It can also be used by organizations to evaluate and compare the salaries of their employees.
